## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have been having trouble with flexbox lately. Had to relearn it through YouTube and after getting the concept, I chose this particular challenge to work on it. I learned a lot more about flexbox while doing this task

### Continued development

Now that I have grasped the concept of flexbox. I need to understand CSS Grid and CSS Frameworks
